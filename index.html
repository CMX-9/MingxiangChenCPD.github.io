                <h3><em>Workpiece Inspection</em></h3>
                <p>Gigabit Ethernet industrial cameras are used to acquire pictures in real time, and on the Microsoft Visual C++ platform, image processing knowledge is applied to achieve workpiece classification detection (such as screws, nuts, etc.) and automatic recognition. Automatic identification of workpiece categories, counting the number of workpieces and area. First of all, image grey scale and binarization processing, the presence of noise on the image will affect the detection, so it is necessary to further image denoising pre-processing, and then find the connecting region, through the boundary detection and region growth and other ways to obtain features (size, shape, area, grey value of the centre and other features), and finally to achieve the goal of detecting and identifying.</p>

                <h3><em>Small Target Detection</em></h3>
                <p>In Visual Studio platform, C programming is used to achieve the detection of small targets on ships based on multi-feature analysis and morphological reconstruction. Accompanied by complex sea clutter background of different sizes, different numbers, different brightness, different shapes of the ship targets have a low false detection rate, the detection results using a rectangular box, the output of the number of detection results and the specific location. The algorithm demonstrates robustness in varying weather conditions and achieves 92% detection accuracy in real-world scenarios.</p>
